# Soccer Spatial Shot Analysis
Spatial analysis of soccer shot locations and scoring probability using expected goals (xG) data.

## Overview
This lab explores the spatial distribution of soccer shots using expected goals (xG) data.
Shot locations are binned across the pitch to visualize scoring probability using both
heatmaps and continuous probability surfaces.

## Methods
- Shot location extraction
- Spatial binning of xG values
- Visualization using heatmaps and contour-based probability surfaces

## Tools
Python, pandas, matplotlib, mplsoccer
